## AdBlocker
We are using adblockers from [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) and [Cliqz](https://cliqz.com/). This library is easy to use and built on javascript for blocking ads. 
For more information about Cliqz's Adblocker please refer [Cliqz Adblocker](https://github.com/ghostery/adblocker.git).

## Future Implementations
- Need to add navigation 
- Add tabs
- Integrate chrome Adblocker extensions to block ads more efficiently


## Issues
- Sometimes observing an ad at start of the video
- No navigation buttons

For any question, feel free to [open an issue ](https://github.com/rinavolu/Youtube-Application/issues/new) or a pull request to get some help!

## Note
I'm new to electronJs. Feel free to suggest if any features can be integrated. I'll try my best to add more features to this application.
Thank you so much for going through this project ‚ù§Ô∏è
